# Stability folders
Because of the stability test, I made two test case. 
In no_care_stability, it uses the input case like [1,2,3,...]
In care_stability, it uses the input case like [[1,2], [1,1], [2,3],...] to test stability
So the algorithm codes are little bit different each other to accept different input case.
I used no_care_stability codes as basic structure.
