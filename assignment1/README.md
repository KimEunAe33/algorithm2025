# Notice!
After completing the code initially and recording the execution time, 
I realized that I also needed to check memory usage and stability for the report. 
Additionally, I had only tested with data ranges of 1k, 10k, and 100k. 
After I found it, I changed the data ranges to 1k, 10k, 100k, and 1M, 
but I noticed that it would be impossible to run the tests before the assignment submission. 
Some of algorithms took over 2 hours to sort 1M for once. 
Therefore, I ran the tests for 1M only once each. I'm so sorry about it.
